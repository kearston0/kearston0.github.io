# Fridge Door

Welcome to **Fridge Door** — a collaborative blog platform designed for writers, artists, and creators to share ideas in an open, interactive, and secure environment. Inspired by the way families and roommates use fridge doors to leave notes, reminders, and doodles, our platform fosters creativity and community.
