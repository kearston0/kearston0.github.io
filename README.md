Fridge Door

Welcome to Fridge Door! This is a collaborative blog platform designed for writers, artists, and creators to share ideas in an open, interactive, and secure environment. Inspired by the way families and roommates use fridge doors to leave notes, reminders, and doodles, our platform fosters creativity and community.

Post and share creative content — from blog posts to artwork.

Collaborate on edits and drafts through GitHub's version control.

Scale seamlessly with cloud hosting.

The platform’s name reflects our roots as "lab rats" and the simple yet powerful concept of a communal space for shared thoughts.
